### GM 👋

I'm Arjan, a web3 developer with a strong financial background. I like to work with Rust, Solidity and Python. I am mainly interested in economics, banking and game theory. 

- 🎓 Educational Background: Masters in Behavioural Economics & Game Theory and Financial Law.
- 🏢 Professional Journey: Transitioned from a career in corporate finance to software development. Gained valuable experience working the core banking solutions at Sopra Banking and working on an API gateway for for an online casino at Trifork.
- 🔭 Current Focus: Building Super Leo Lig, a football manager game on Aleo. The privacy that Aleo provides with ZK is used to hide a user's strategies from opponents before the game, while allowing users to verify the opponenets strategy after the game.
